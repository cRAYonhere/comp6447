# Course Summary
This course looks at cyber attack and defence. Students learn how to assess and identify vulnerabilities and how vulnerabilities are exploited. Students learn the principles and theory of exploitation, the common security models, and how approaches to exploitation and defence have evolved over time.  

Students from this course will engage in war games competitions, analyse real world case studies of vulnerabilities in complex software used on widespread systems, and gain an understanding of the technical process of finding and fixing low-level software vulnerabilities and also of the economics and causal factors involved with their real world use.  

The course covers techniques and skills including vulnerability classes, source code auditing, fuzzing, security bugs, software security assurance, taint analysis, memory corruption, overflows and return oriented programming . The c ourse coverage will be constantly updated over time to reflect emerging attack and defence methods.  

There are numerous formative assessments and activities throughout the course to provide feedback and learning opportunities. These do not directly contribute to your final grade but are expected to be used to provide evidence of your capabilities in your portfolio.  

Students need a keen, devious and analytical mind. To get the most from this course students will need to engage in independent study and research and be able to act as independent self directed learners.  

Binary exploits = hardcore.  

# BEWARE

To get the most from these courses you will need to engage in independent study and act as a self directed learner. Attending lectures alone will not be sufficient to pass the course. You will need to devote considerable practice to all the techniques we cover and read further on topics which interest you or which you do not fully understand. For a credit level result we expect you will spend 11 hours per week in total on this course, including over the mid semester break.  

Seek feedback from your friendly lecturers and class peers constantly over the semester and closely monitor yourself to make sure you are not falling behind. We treat you like adults and do not force you to do the self directed work and practice - but experience has shown that students who do not work hard in the course do not do well, and often express disappointment later on at the missed opportunity. (Since we have awesome tutors and speakers here for you during the course - make sure you make full use of them and your time.)  

# Assumed Knowledge  
You need to have taken and passed COMP6441 or COMP6841 or COMP3441 or COMP9321.  

Prior to commencing the course, students should have an understanding of how computers work, including the following:  

Virtual Memory  
C  
Linux  
If you have any knowledge gaps, you will need to take responsibility for covering those topics in your own time with private practice and study.  

# Student Learning Outcomes  
After completing this course, you will:  

Have a knowledge of the principle elements of offensive cyber security (such as vulnerability classes, source code auditing, fuzzing, security bugs, software security assurance and testing, taint analysis, memory corruption, numeric overflows, return oriented programming)  
Recognise and explain how these elements can be exploited by attackers, their characterising features, weaknesses and countermeasures  
Given a system being able to identify and analyse its key vulnerabilities and design and implement reliable exploits to make use of this  
Given a system being able to identify and analyse its key vulnerabilities and design and implement reliable remedies and countermeasures to prevent successful exploitation  
Have an understanding of the key legal, ethical, and professional issues of offensive-defence; and to be able to apply this understanding to design and conduct professional offensive-defence operations.
